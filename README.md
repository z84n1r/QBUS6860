Background
In this assignment you will be required to undertake a preliminary data analysis on a large dataset of schools in NSW. You must present your results in a 10-minute video to be uploaded to Canvas. You must motivate your analysis as if it is solving a real business problem. You should also submit your slides and any Python code used to generate your visualisations   
Data
The data are available as part of the NSW government’s open data policy and can be accessed   hereLinks to an external site..
The data can be downloaded   here   Download here. A document describing the variables is available   here   Download here. You may consider using zipped versions of the shapefiles for   Local Government Areas (LGAs)   Download Local Government Areas (LGAs)and   SA4 regions   Download SA4 regions, but this is not mandatory.

Instructions
Your presentation should:
·   Include   at least three   visualisations.
·   Be   no longer than   10 minutes.
·   You   must show your face   during the presentation as well as the slides.
There are no other restrictions on your presentation. You do not need not use every variable or every observation in the dataset. It is likely that you will need to do some data cleaning and preparation using the concepts that we covered in Week 2. You may use any kinds of visualisation whether they be simple (e.g. bar charts) or complex (e.g. choropleths and interactive plots). See the rubric below for an indication of the marking criteria.
An important part of the assignment is showing that you can motivate your visualisations in a business setting. To do this, provide a context for your prese代 写QBUS6860 Data analysis A1Python

·   A consultant hired by the NSW Department of Education
·   An owner of a company providing pre-school services
·   A data scientist at a non-government organisation supporting economically disadvantaged students
·   Something else
Each of these individuals will focus on different aspects of the data. To make the perspective of the assignment clear, you may choose to open your presentation with   “I am XXX and I am a data scientist   from the NSW Department of Education”   or   “I am XXX and work for a   non-profit tasked to advocate for indigenous education”.
Video Submission
Making your video
Your   video   should include visuals of your Powerpoint slides overlaid with a webcam recording   of you speaking your presentation. To record the   video, you can use Zoom.   The following   linkLinks to an external site.   describes how to make a recording –   we recommend to use the “Record on this Computer”   option. To make the Powerpoint presentation part of the video make sure you share your   screen using Zoom, instructions can be found   hereLinks to an external site..   Note that if you would prefer to use different software for making a video other than Zoom,   that is also fine.
Submitting your video
When you have recorded your video and saved it to your computer, you will be ready to submit. Please select the "Submit Assignment" button at the top right of this page. You will upload your video using the   Studio   icon in   the text edit toolbar (shown in screenshot with red arrow).
